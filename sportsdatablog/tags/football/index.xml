      <description>With 8 games complete in the 2022 college football season, we already have (or should have) a decent handle on where our favorite teams stand in the NCAA D1 universe. Texas A&amp;amp;M is not who many thought they were, while Syracuse and Kansas are among the teams that have exceeded expectations thus far. Today we’ll be looking at two measures of a team’s efficiency: Offensive/Defensive Yards per Play, and how they relate to a team’s wins that season.</description>

      <description>Today we’re analyzing recruiting rankings and seeing if they have any impact on winning in college football. Our intuition says… maybe? Let’s find out.
We’ll load in tidyverse and our datasets with the team records by year and recruiting rankings.

      <description>Today we are looking at incidences of interceptions that happend from the first play from scrimmage of a half. We will use college football play by play data to do this from the cfbfastR package. Connor Bazelak threw two at the beginning of each half on Saturday. We want to know just how rare that is.

      <description>Let’s take a look at some averages from the 2021-22 NCAA Football season. We want to look at average offensive plays per game from Big Ten teams. In order to do this, we will first load in the tidyverse library and pull the data as a csv from this url. Once we have the data, it will be stored in a variable called fblogs.
